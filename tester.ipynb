As you know, this is a critical priority – for Congress, for the Administration, and for the American people who will bear the pain of a default.  This has been done by previous Congresses with no conditions attached and this Congress should act quickly to do so now.\\n \\nWe can agree that an unprecedented default would inflict needless economic pain on hard working Americans and that the American people have no interest in brinksmanship.  That is why House Democrats joined with House Republicans and voted to avoid default throughout the Trump Administration – without conditions, despite disagreements about budget priorities. That same standard should apply today.\\n \\nSeparately, as you and I discussed earlier, I look forward to talking with you about our nation’s economic and fiscal future…'},\n",

As I have repeatedly said, that conversation must be separate from prompt action on Congress’ basic obligation to pay the nation’s bills and avoid economic catastrophe.\\n \\nI look forward to your response, to eliminating the specter of default, and to your budget.'}],\n",
